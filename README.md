# lyka-face
Playing around with facial recognition libraries.

Content partially taken from [openface](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/openface), [opencv](http://opencv.org/), and others

Some videos and extracted data omitted in facial-recognition/peanut as they are private.

Possibly more to come soon? Actually, probably not.
